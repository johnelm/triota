### Easy, flexible API testing

IOTA allows you to define API requests in YAML as templates

For making utility calls, assertions, or API-only testing

Serialized requests easily imported from Postman


```yaml

login:
  method: POST
  url: https://accounts.yourco.com/access_client/sign_in
  headers:
    cache-control: no-cache
    offeringid: ${offerings.offeringId}
    content-type: application/json
  body:
    username: ${userID}
    password: ${password}
  json: true
```



- request templates

if no values given, will fall back to values provided in testdata


```
request templates
	again, can use test data here
	API testing
		serialization of requests
		injection of variables / values
		used for API testing
		and performing actions via API within flows
			assertions on API
			creation of new users
```

```
also javascript
	Javascript DSL

		using IOTAâ€™s babel configuration, saving the author the trouble
		ScenarioFunctionActions should be able to extend any Type defined

	cookie injection
```
