		coverage
		webdriver
			specific targets, i.e. saucelabs
		results
		reporting
	layered approach to building performables
		layers
		mixins
			more maintainable than object hierarchy
			eliminates brittle conditional constructs
			multiple inheritance
		supports plugins
		human-readable text for manual testing
			dry-run

exmaples of extensions: coverage 


- extensible, pluggable architecture
- performer decoration and multiple inheritance via mixins
